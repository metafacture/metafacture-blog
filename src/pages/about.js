      Metafacture is a toolkit for processing semi-structured data with a focus on library metadata. 
      It provides a versatile set of tools for reading, writing and transforming data. 
      Metafacture can be used as a stand-alone application or as a Java library in other applications. 
      The name Metafacture is a portmanteau of the words meta data and manufacture.
