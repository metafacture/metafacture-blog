# Metafacture Blog

This project is the source for the new metafacture blog.
This project was created with the gatsby template [gatsby-starter-blog](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog).


## Start developing

```
cd metafacture-blog
gatsby develop
```

The site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

## Build

To create a production build and output the built static files into the public directory, run:

```
cd metafacture-blog
gatsby build
```

If you want to view the production build locally, run:

```

Once this starts, you can view your site at http://localhost:9000.
